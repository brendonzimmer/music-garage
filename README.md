# welcome to music-garage!

This is a rough version of a service to transfer songs from Spotify to Apple Music, utilizing both of their APIs and Next.js

There is a discover page to see my public spotify playlists, and a transfer page to connect your accounts to transfer songs from Spotify to Apple Music

This was created in a couple weeks of messing around, and is by no means a finished product

Also! I have started a new repo to re-build this app with new unique and more complex features
